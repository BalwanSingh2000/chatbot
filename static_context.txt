A: 

## Q: Q-39.  How to process my certificate?
A: 

## Q: Q-40.  Do I have a class today?
A: 

## Q: Q-41. I have an issue , the tests which have  been assigned to us , are completely different from what is being taught in the class .
A: like we are being taught quite the basics of everything , and the tests are asking for deep knowledge.
Q-... I don't know what to do,  and what to do ?
like will we be taught the depth of every topic, if not how would we be able to attempt the test?
I don't want to Google anything for answers,and cheat
 but at the same time I'm unable to understand some of the questions as they haven't even been touched in the class.


1. The test that is assigned is for self-practice so that we can push you for something extra. We cover practical and overall approaches toward counseling and make tests outside of what is covered in class because in the future when you will be a counselor and patients will come they will not know what you have covered in class and what not. This time life is changing every day and self-learning and self-growth is also important. 
2. We have covered depth knowledge with basic content because if we will cover only deep topics it will become very difficult for you to understand the concept. For this, we will recommend you watch the video again and read the study material. 
3. You can explore more and get yourself prepared for the test, that's why we allowed two attempts. 
4. By the end of the course you will be getting ready for in-depth counseling. Also, we feel there is no end to depth. It depends on individual curiosity. 
5. Please use Google to learn and explore more and not cheat. Because you are a future counselor and you will get multi-dimensional clients. 
6. Also, if you feel the questions are not touched in class you can ask about that topic with the trainer in practice sessions and give the test again as a 2nd attempt. 
Hope this email will help you. Do let me know of any other queries.

## Q: Q-42.  lost certificate
A: Ans.  If the certificate is lost Counsel India is not responsible for that and if you want a new one you have to pay the surcharge as a Penalty of Rs 500.

## Q: Q-43.  We request you  to provide access to live classes and videos on the laptop screen. It is difficult to follow on the mobile.
A: Ans. We really apologize for this, as we tried this in previous days but our content got leaked and videos were seriously tampered by some clients. So due to privacy reasons, we have stopped Laptop access for videos. You can use tab or Android TVs to see videos on a bigger screen.

## Q: Q-44.  Not attending the classes and assignments.
A: We have sent you multiple requests on App chat to complete your assignments and submit them so that your certificates can be released. Also, the Certificate confirmation message you sent in the Group chat is incomplete and very improper.
This is really sad to see future counselors working styles.
Respond to this email ASAP. 
Also, you have attended only 50% of classes and according to our policy, you are not eligible for a certificate if your attendance is less than 75%.

## Q: Q-45. A problem related to Hindi language?
A: This is a class where the teacher is using basic English and in Psychology, we have to use the English language by force because Psychology is a subject where Hindi literature and content is not much available. So, to understand it properly please watch a recording of the class for a better understanding of the session.
We completely support the Hindi language and we are not biased towards foreign languages and we also respect Hindi as our mother language but there are certain limitations that we have to understand. 
I promise you that we tried very hard to find Hindi content for you but Therapies are still not found in Devnagri Lipi and so we failed to produce content in Hindi.

## Q: Q-46.  Not satisfied with the course.
A: Let us guide you here only.


1. Number of classes was well-informed before the registration. We expect participants to register only after they know the course roadmap. Along with this, every month you will get 1 Module session, 1 Practice session, 1 Marketing session, and 1 Procedure session. Then only we will be able to provide all 60 sessions in 12 to 15 Months.


2. If you are from a non-psychology background and want extra learning, you can refer to the Recorded videos, and additional study material and attend practice, procedure, and marketing classes regularly as they are most important, and discuss your doubts with a trainer to learn more by staying on camera. 


Resource material for additional learning.

3. Self-learning is the only method practiced worldwide to learn counseling. First is self-learning, research, and then asking doubts. Spoon-feeding to professionals and counseling aspirants is not possible. You have to focus on overall growth and let us know your challenges and doubts. We will surely help you. Along with this, all therapies are explained as per the requirement. If you need some special focus on some therapy, please let us know. 


4. Finding time is completely your choice Madhu, we can't help you to find the time. All professionals who want to become successful are masters in time management. The counseling profession needs time and proper duration to understand everything deeply. Just telling you don't have time is not the solution. All top counsellors spend a good amount of time to excel in this industry. 
 
5. They are not assignments, they are projects for self-learning and this is not a school where what we taught we will give as assignments. This is an ancient and outdated method of learning. Advanced and self-paced learning is completely different from the old method. Projects are given for research and self-learning keeping the overall course and vision in mind. You have to work on this. Also just because they are not explained in class we give you the option to ask your doubts about projects with us directly and we would be happy to help. 


6. If you can't find time, you have to manage something and compromise. Learning needs dedication and commitment. We are not a tuition center to tell you how to learn. Time is something you have to manage and we are there to support you, guide you and provide services whatever is promised during the time of registration. 


7. EMI is something that is not connected with your time management and you can't threaten us in the name of EMI. We gave you the option to support yourself and not put any financial burden on you. But don't take it in a way that if you can't find the time, you tell us to stop EMI.


8. Also we are completely flexible with many things, i.e. if you can't attend the session you can watch the recording, and you can connect with our mentor for help, flexibility project submission etc etc.




The Overall conclusion is we have a long way to go. We both have to work together to get better results. One way is not to achieve success in life. 


If your doubts are still not cleared, feel free to connect with our Sr mentor who helped more than 25000+ participants to grow on the number given in previous mail.

## Q: Q- 47.  Did Not inform before the class
